# PLAN.md — MVP Build Order (SPEC §16)

Sequential build order. Each step ends with **tests passing**, **FR/NFR verified**,
**a runnable app**, and a **commit**. Check boxes as steps complete. The
submission → duplicate-detection → teacher-approval pipeline (steps 6–8) is the
highest-value, highest-risk path and is built before any games.

## Step 1 — Scaffold ✅
- [x] Monorepo (apps/web Next.js, apps/api NestJS, packages/types, packages/config)
- [x] Strict TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier wired across workspaces
- [x] Prisma initialized (generator + datasource, `pg_trgm` extension; full schema = Step 2)
- [x] Docker Compose: Postgres + Redis
- [x] `.env.example` with all config keys (no secrets)
- [x] CI: install → prisma generate → build types → lint → typecheck → test
- [x] Empty web + api boot; health check endpoint (`GET /api/v1/health`)
- **Verify:** ✅ typecheck/lint/test green (api 2 unit + 1 e2e, web 5 i18n); api + web
  production builds succeed. ⚠️ `docker compose up` not runnable in this sandbox
  (Docker CLI absent) — compose file validated by inspection; run locally to confirm.

## Step 2 — Schema, migrations & seed ✅
- [x] Prisma schema for ALL §7 entities (identity, dictionary, contribution/review,
      learning/gamification, platform/ops); `school_id` nullable everywhere (G-12)
- [x] `pg_trgm` extension + GIN trigram index on `words.normalized_lemma` (powers dedup,
      G-4). FTS (tsvector) query config lands with the Dictionary read slice (Phase C-3).
- [x] Initial migration checked in (`prisma/migrations/0_init`)
- [x] Seed: School #29, taxonomy (Appendix A: levels, age groups, topic tree), admin,
      dup-threshold setting
- **Verify:** ✅ `prisma validate` clean; client generates; migration has pg_trgm +
  trigram GIN index; NFR-06 versioning/provenance fields present (`word_versions`,
  `words.source/approved_by/approved_at/current_version`). ⚠️ live `migrate deploy`/`db:seed`
  require Postgres (not runnable in this sandbox — run locally). **Commit.**

## Step 3 — Auth & RBAC
- [ ] register / verify-email / login / refresh / logout (AUTH-01/02/04)
- [ ] Learner class-code/PIN login (AUTH-03, G-1); no self-registration for minors
- [ ] RBAC guard/middleware enforced server-side on every route (AUTH-06, deny by default)
- [ ] `GET /auth/me`
- [ ] Password policy, lockout, rate limiting (AUTH-04/05, G-14)
- [ ] Auth/audit logging: login, logout, role change, failed login (AUTH-07, NFR-12)
- **Verify:** FR-28, FR-29, AUTH-01..11; RBAC integration tests per role. **Commit.**

## Step 4 — Topics + taxonomy API/admin
- [ ] `GET /topics` (tree), `GET /levels`, `GET /age-groups`
- [ ] Admin CRUD for topics (hierarchical), levels, age groups (S-27)
- **Verify:** FR-08 taxonomy; admin-only enforcement. **Commit.**

## Step 5 — Words read API + dictionary UI
- [ ] `GET /words` list/search (`?q&topic&level&age&page`) via pg_trgm + FTS (FR-01/08)
- [ ] `GET /words/:id` detail incl. variants + media (FR-09)
- [ ] `GET /words/:id/variants` (FR-10)
- [ ] Only `approved` words public (FR-13)
- [ ] UI: dictionary browse w/ topic tiles (S-06), search results (S-07), word detail (S-08)
- [ ] Minor-PII stripping on any user data returned (AUTH-11, FR-07)
- **Verify:** FR-01/08/09/10/13; word-detail interactive perf target (NFR-03). **Commit.**

## Step 6 — Media upload
- [ ] `POST /media/upload-url` signed upload URL, type/size validation (G-7)
- [ ] `POST /media` register asset + consent ref (AUTH-10, FR-24)
- [ ] `GET /media/:id` role-aware signed/public URL (AUTH-09)
- [ ] Transcode worker (BullMQ + ffmpeg): MP4 + poster thumbnail (NFR-03)
- [ ] Consent gating enforced before publish
- **Verify:** FR-24, AUTH-09/10, NFR-03/05; reject oversize/wrong-type. **Commit.**

## Step 7 — Submissions + duplicate detection
- [ ] `POST /submissions` create `pending` (FR-02), triggers dup-check
- [ ] Duplicate detection: normalized exact + trigram, topic-scoped, configurable
      threshold; record every comparison in `duplicate_checks` (FR-03, G-4)
- [ ] `GET /submissions/check-duplicate?lemma=` live hint (FR-03)
- [ ] `GET /submissions/mine` (FR-30)
- [ ] On strong match → mark `duplicate`, link `duplicate_of_word_id`, show existing word,
      **suppress** teacher notification (FR-03/FR-21)
- [ ] UI: submit form w/ live dup hint (S-09), my submissions (S-10)
- **Verify:** FR-02/03/30; dup suppression test. **Commit.**

## Step 8 — Review workflow
- [ ] `GET /submissions` review queue, priority sort (FR-22)
- [ ] `GET /submissions/:id` w/ duplicate candidates
- [ ] approve / reject / edit / request-clarification (FR-04/11/12)
- [ ] `POST /submissions/batch-approve` (FR-22)
- [ ] On approve → create `approved` word, classify, write `word_version`, notify
      contributor (FR-04, FR-23/NFR-06)
- [ ] Notifications + suppression rule (FR-21); in-app notification center (S-24)
- [ ] Audit log on every review action (FR-23, NFR-12)
- [ ] UI: review queue (S-20), review detail side-by-side (S-21), word editor (S-22),
      teacher dashboard (S-23)
- **Verify:** FR-04/11/12/21/22/23; end-to-end submit→dedup→review→publish. **Commit.**

## Step 9 — Admin dashboard
- [ ] `GET /admin/dashboard` KPIs: total/pending/approved/duplicates (FR-06, S-25)
- [ ] `GET /admin/reports/*` approved %, duplicate, usage (FR-25, S-32)
- [ ] `POST /admin/imports` CSV/JSON bulk import (G-13, S-29)
- [ ] `GET /admin/consents` consent records (FR-24, S-31)
- [ ] `GET/PATCH /admin/settings` thresholds/flags (S-34)
- [ ] `GET /admin/audit-logs` (FR-23, S-33); user management (S-26)
- **Verify:** FR-06/23/24/25; admin-only enforcement. **Commit.**

## Step 10 — Games

## Step 11 — Feedback, a11y audit & hardening
- [ ] `POST /feedback` collection (FR-26, S-32)
- [ ] Accessibility audit: axe + Lighthouse + manual keyboard pass (NFR-01)
- [ ] Hardening: rate limits, validation review, CSRF, signed-URL review (NFR-04)
- [ ] Backups + monitoring/alerting setup; documented restore (NFR-07, G-10)

## Full-platform build (Phases A–C) — every §6 screen + §8 endpoint

Overlay on the step plan above: deliver the whole platform UI+API. Phase A is
frontend-only (no DB). **Phases B & C require Step 2 (schema/migrations/seed) first.**

### Phase A — Design system ✅ (frontend, no DB)
- [x] `packages/ui`: tokens (AA palette, type scale, radius, elevation, ≥44px touch) +
      Tailwind preset
- [x] A11y primitives: Button, IconButton, Field/Input, Textarea, Select, Dialog, Tabs,
      Toast, Card, Badge/StatusBadge, VideoPlayer (captions toggle, muted, no autoplay
      sound), Table, Pagination, EmptyState, Skeleton, VisuallyHidden — keyboard-operable,
      visible focus, ARIA
- [x] RBAC route-group shells: (public)/(learner)/(teacher)/(admin), each with nav +
      server-side role guard + mobile-first responsive nav
- [x] Deaf-first rules baked in (visual/text-first, video-centric, color never sole signal)
- [x] All strings via i18n (mn default + en parity)
- [x] `/design-system` preview route (tokens + every primitive) + RoleSwitcher
- **Verify:** ✅ typecheck/lint clean; ui 7 + web 5 + api 2 tests pass; `next build` green
  (8 routes). Tokens confirmed in built CSS. ⏸️ **Awaiting design approval before Phase B.**

### Phase B — API foundation ✅ (needs Step 2 schema)
- [x] Error envelope, validation pipe, pagination helper, **global** RBAC guards
      (JwtAuthGuard + RolesGuard, deny-by-default) on every endpoint, audit-log
      interceptor; OpenAPI/Swagger at `/api/docs`
- [x] Auth module: `/auth/*` — register / verify-email / login / login/class-code /
      refresh / logout / forgot-password / reset-password / me; JWT access + rotating
      refresh cookie (SHA-256 hashed, rotated); throttler rate limiting + account lockout
- **Verify:** ✅ typecheck/lint clean; api **23 unit + 1 e2e** pass (RolesGuard rank
  ladder, login lockout/enumeration-safety, token duration parsing); `nest build` green.
  AUTH-01/02/03/04/05/06/07/11, FR-28/29, NFR-04/12 covered. Live auth flows need
  Postgres (run locally). **Commit.**

### Phase C — Vertical slices (API + screens together)
- [ ] 1 Auth & onboarding (S-02,03,04) · 2 Topics/taxonomy (S-27) · 3 Dictionary read
      (S-06,07,08) · 4 Media upload · 5 Submissions+dedup (S-09,10, CRITICAL PATH) ·
      6 Review workflow (S-20–23) · 7 Admin (S-25,26,28–34) · 8 Games (S-11–17) ·
      9 Notifications/feedback/a11y settings (S-19,24) · 10 Hardening (axe/Lighthouse,
      security, seed, README)
